# Installation And CLI

Run every command in this guide from the repository root.

## Install The Python Package

Install Journey SDK into an existing Python environment:

```bash
pip install journey-sdk
```

Add Journey SDK to a `uv` project:

```bash
uv add journey-sdk
```

Import the Journey SDK API from `journeysdk`:

```python
from journeysdk import journey, step
```

## Install The CLI

Run the CLI once without installing it:

```bash
uvx --from journey-sdk journey --help
```

Install a persistent `journey` command with `uv`:

```bash
uv tool install journey-sdk
journey --help
```

If your shell cannot find the command yet, refresh the shell PATH integration:

```bash
uv tool update-shell
```

Install the CLI inside a virtual environment with `pip`:

```bash
python -m pip install journey-sdk
journey --help
```

Use the CLI from a project-local environment:

```bash
uv add journey-sdk
uv run journey --help
```

## Browser Setup

Playwright and LiteLLM are included in the default package install. The first Journey browser step automatically
downloads Chromium in the active environment. That first launch needs network access and can take a moment.

## Local Development Installs

Install the current checkout with `pip`:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Add the current checkout to a `uv` project:

```bash
uv add --editable /path/to/journey-sdk
```

Install the CLI directly from a local checkout:

```bash
uv tool install --editable /path/to/journey-sdk
journey --help
```

## AI Agent Skill

AI coding agents can use the source-distributed
[`journey-developer` skill](../skills/journey-developer/SKILL.md) for Journey authoring, targeted `--step` runs,
`--develop-step` loops, and persistent `--state` guidance. See [`../skills/README.md`](../skills/README.md) for the
minimal install notes.
